# Better DIY Extension Trackers

One frustrations many meet when making DIY SlimeVR tracker sets are extension trackers, instead of ignoring the issues or just straight up avoiding extension trackers lets address the issues and try to resolve them! 

Within this GitHub Repository youâ€™ll find files to make your own Carrier PCBs, 3D Printing files for extension cases for the PCBs, how to prolong the longevity and reliability of JST Cables, and other information I hope you find helpful. 

# Extension Carrier PCBs

## Heat-shrink Tubing
- Preferred Specifications
    - Ratio: 3:1
    - Outside Diameter: 3/8th in or 9.5 mm
    - Length: 7.5 inches or 19 cm
        - *size may vary due to manufacturing tolerances.
    - Recommendation:
        - *Getting "higher quality" or marine-grade heat-shrink will result in tubing that is too thick or stiff for usage resulting in cables unplugging themselves.

### Printing Recommendations

- PETG or Better Recommended
- **Ensure a pause is inserted allowing for embedded installation of aux module.**
- Disable Supports
- Default "Standard // Strength" settings are fine.
- Ensure the filament/printer you are using to print this case is tuned well for printing overhangs.
