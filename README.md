# Better DIY Extension Trackers

One frustration many encounter when making DIY SlimeVR tracker sets is extension trackers; instead of ignoring the issues or just straight-up avoiding extension trackers, let's address them and try to resolve them! 

Within this GitHub Repository, youâ€™ll find files to make your own Carrier PCBs, 3D-printing files for extension cases for the PCBs, information on prolonging the longevity and reliability of JST Cables, and other helpful information.

# JST Cable
### SlimeVR Store Source
https://shop.slimevr.dev/collections/all 

### AliExpress Source
Required Specs - **Mirrored // 1.25mm Pitch // 4 or 5 pin.**

[AliExpress Source](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802516363127.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.17231802YL7W6Q&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) 
> Please check for the right selection of options.

For Ankle to Foot Extensions, I recommend 20 or 30 cm.



## Heat-shrink Tubing (Not Recommended after testing; treat JST Cables as consumables or buy upgraded JST Cables from SlimeVR Store).
- Preferred Specifications
    - Ratio: 3:1
    - Outside Diameter: 3/8th in or 9.5 mm
    - Length: 7.5 inches or 19 cm
        - *size may vary due to manufacturing tolerances.
    - Recommendation:
        - *Getting "higher quality" or marine-grade heat shrink will result in tubing that is too thick or stiff for usage, causing cables to unplug themselves.
        - Recommended USA Source: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BZE0KCC/)
    
## 3D Printed Cases

For BMI270 Pinout: [File Preview] Not made at the moment.

### Printing Recommendations

- PETG or Better Recommended
- **Ensure a pause is inserted, allowing for embedded installation of the aux module.**
- Disable Supports
- Default "Standard // Strength" settings are fine.
- Ensure the filament/printer you use is tuned well for overhangs.
